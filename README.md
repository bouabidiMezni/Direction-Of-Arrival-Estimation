# Direction-Of-Arrival-Estimation
We are Imen BOUABIDI and Ameni MEZNI telecommunication enginners students.We study in the National Engineering School of Tunis.


The problem of estimating direction-of-arrivals of multiple plane waves impinging on an arbitrary array of sensors has paid a lot of attention.It has played an important role in many applications including wireless communication , radar and sonar, radio astronomy etc .

This work is dedicated for person who deal with Direction Of Arrival Estimation in their thesis.

We implement in here directions of arrival estimation techniques:Subspace and the Non-Subspace methods . MATLAB is used for simulating the algorithms.Subspace methods are MUSIC , Root-MUSIC and ESPRIT . Non-Subspace methods are Beamforming and capon.

The commun assumption in all these methods are:
